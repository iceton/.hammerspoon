# .hammerspoon - my spoons/config

- **CryptoMenubar** displays Bitcoin and Ethereum price and gas stats in the menubar
- **LoadAlert** notifies when system CPU load is high for power usage awareness
- **NetworkWatcher** provides external DNS switching and connection display via menubar and notifications
- **ScreenManager** watches for screen/monitor change events and resizes windows accordingly

I made these [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) spoons to add functionality to MacOS. I use them daily and refine them often.

They started as bits of [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix) config before moving to Hammerspoon for deeper integration.
